In this project, I applied several RNN structures to complete a machine translation task from English to French on a given corpus data.
The models include simple LSTM, LSTM with embedded layer, Bidirectional LSTM, Attention Encoder-Decoder, and a full model that combines 
all of the above. The full model is able to reach about 98% validation accuracy.
